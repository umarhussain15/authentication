        <p>
        We are just a bunch people of trying to bring a change through the Education. We hope to impart upon our volunteers a sense of responsibility towards the run down institutes within their localities and other associated areas. With the aim of going through with this project with all that we have got. 
        <ol>
            <li>To impart a sense of responsibility upon the students.</li>    
            <li>To improve the condition of the schools by making necessary repairs.</li>    
            <li>To make people aware of the unsatisfactory conditions that many schools are in.</li>    
            <li>To ensure that students of the schools renovated are contented with the changes.</li>    
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>The intended beneficiaries are the students, whose lives will be directly affected by the project. The first phase of the project aims to create an environment where the students would want to study and learn. This includes not only the students studying in the school right now but for years to come.</li>    
            <li>Faculty and administration of the schools will also benefit from this project as this will provide them with a place where they can teach in an effective manner and help the students achieve their full potential.</li>    
            <li>At the same time the surrounding community is also going to be affected by the renovation of the school. The students when they return to their communities will spread the knowledge they have gained to the rest of the community members they interact with, slowly but surely changing the outlook and perspective of that community while opening doors of new opportunities for them. </li>    
            <li>This project will help NUST students gain excellent project management skills and the experience of overcoming difficulties in executing such a large project on their own. Moreover, this project will also give them a chance to understand the difficulties of the deprived members of our community and how they can play an important role in in minimizing their deprivations.</li>
